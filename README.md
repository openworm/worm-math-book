# WormMathBook

This book aims to focus on the most important mathematical concepts and models of the OpenWorm project. The entire book is online and built using the [Jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book) project.

* Each chapter is dedicated to a major project
  * Each section of the chapter is a standalone Jupyter Notebook
    * Describing a concept, related videos/simulations/animations, examples, codes, and excercises
* At the end of each section we have some mathematical problems to be solved
  * Concepts, questions and solutions first being proposed on the [Discussions page](https://github.com/openworm/worm-math-book/discussions)
    * If approved, will be added to the book
* Queries for each code come from the **[owmeta](https://github.com/openworm/owmeta)** project
  * Using the rdf relations we try to connect a question to the related ontology in our knowledge-base
  * We try to have a parametric look into the code segments and questions
* [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org) is beeing used to work with math and python
* Related simulations are finally represtented through our simulation projects

### Structure and Scenario

The book is following a cycle of the C. **EL**egans' life. Each day some new capabilities are added and the worm becomes more complex. The questions regarding the new complexity, related math problems and solutions are discussed. Finally, an existing or a proposed model/simulation could be added in order to better demonstrate the process.

**Part 1: Creation**

* Day 1: The El's world is created and the El's egg is put into it
* Day 2: The cell's clock starts to work and gene regulations begin to happen
* Day 3: The cell proliferates and different cells start functioning based on their fates
* Day 4: The El’s body comes to existence and interacts with the environment

**Part 2: Networks**

* Day 5: A first circuit of body cells start to interact
* Day 6: A neural network appears in the head and starts to interact with the body
* Day 7: Behold; one shall not work on weekends. El stops working on this day and tries to understand where all the noises and leaky currents come from!
* Day 8: El now has a full functioning network of neural and muscle cells

**Part 3: Movement**

* Day 9: The first command for a sinusoidal movement comes from El’s head
* Day 10: El tries to crawl in the liquid environment
* Day 11: El moves around and finds the beach, so, El tries to move on the soil
* Day 12: El goes back to the liquid world, moves and moves until feels tiredness and hungriness

**Part 4: In joy**

* Day 13: El senses a food source, goes toward the source and starts eating
* Day 14: Behold; one shall not work on weekends. El tries to understand how to use the toilet instead.
* Day 15: El feels loneliness, moves around, finds a mate, and falls in love
* Day 16: El’s wife starts lying eggs

**Part 5: In danger**

* Day 17: El feels someone is touching El saying what are you doing here. El feels threatened starts to run as fast as possible
* Day 18: El finds out El is closing to a toxic environment, so, El tries to scape from there.
* Day 19: El feels a hot environment and tries to avoid entering the place
* Day 20: El feels hungry and can not find a food, so, decides to enter a daur state in the hope of waking up in a food-rich plate

**Part 6: Learning**

* Day 21: Behold; one shall not work on weekends. El decides to continue sleeping. El’s head tries to make a map of where El has gone and what El has done
* Day 22: El wakes up and tries to remember where should El go now.
* Day 23: El tries to makes a decision to go toward the food source or the mate
* Day 24: El goes toward the food source, however, in the middle of the day some temptation says go find your mate. El changes the direction, uses up all the energy and becomes a dead El

### Worm Math Problems and Solutions

Every scenario in the book can contain different questions. Every question then is accompanied by some math problems and solutions. Each question is going to be asked and discussed in the [Discussions page](https://github.com/openworm/worm-math-book/discussions). Selected questions become [issues](https://github.com/openworm/worm-math-book/issues), and when the related math problem(s) are solved a [pull request](https://github.com/openworm/worm-math-book/pulls) for an update to the book takes place.
