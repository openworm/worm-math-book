# WormMathBook

This book aims to focus on the most important mathematical concepts and models of the OpenWorm project. The entire book is online and built using the [Jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book) project.

* Each chapter is dedicated to a major project
  * Each section of the chapter is a standalone Jupyter Notebook
    * Describing a concept, related videos/simulations/animations, examples, codes, and excercises
* At the end of each section we have some mathematical problems to be solved
  * Concepts, questions and solutions first being proposed on the [Discussions page](https://github.com/openworm/worm-math-book/discussions)
    * If approved, will be added to the book
* Queries for each code come from the **[owmeta](https://github.com/openworm/owmeta)** project
  * Using the rdf relations we try to connect a question to the related ontology in our knowledge-base
  * We try to have a parametric look into the code segments and questions
* [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org) is beeing used to work with math and python
* Related simulations are finally represtented through our simulation projects
